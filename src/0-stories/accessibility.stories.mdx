# Accessibility

Fused Components is built with accessibility in mind.  Each component is tested for keyboard accessibility and screen readers using voice over on MacOS. 

The components should follow the guidelines layed out in the following document: https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2/.

Every component has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for the text and background color to meet WCAG 2.0 AA standards.
