# Accessibility

Fused Components is built with accessibility in mind.  Each component is tested for keyboard accessibility and screen readers using voice over on MacOS. 

The components should follow the guidelines layed out in the following document: https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2/.

Every component has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for the text and background color to meet WCAG 2.0 AA standards. 

## Accessibility Recommendations 

If you are using one of the many input like components in this library and they are not tied to a **label** then it is suggested that use use the property **aria-label** on the input.

### Icon component

If you are using the icon component make sure to add a title attribute to describe what the icon is for.  This is already in place for the **CornerDialog**, **Dialog**, and **PanelComponents**.

### If an element should be not be read by a screen reader

If an element should not be readable by a screen reader then aria-hidden should be added to the element.
