# Welcome

Fused Components is a component library created by [Adam Webster](https://adamwebster.me) to help him learn how to create a react based component library.

It is also used in Adam's own applications that he builds including **Fused Budget** and **Fused Invoice**.

## Installing Fused Components

Currently the Fused Components library is hosted on an private GIT repo while he works on the basic code but in the future it would be installed using the following.

`npm install @adamwebster/fused-components`

## Importing components

To import components you want into your UI using the following:

`import { Button, Toggle } from @adamwebster/fused-components`

Which you can use in the following way
```
  const MyComponent = () => (
    <div>
      <Button>Adam's Button</Button>
      <Toggle />
    </div>
  )
```

Fused Components also supports **Typescript** and includes bundled type files for use with your **Typescript** application.
