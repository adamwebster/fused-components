# Get started

FusedComponents design system is a system created by [Adam Webster](https://adamwebster.me) to help him learn how to create a react based component library from creating the components to building and publishing an NPM package.

It is also used in Adam's own applications that he builds including Fused**Budget** and Fused**Invoice**.

# Installing FusedComponents

Currently the FusedComponents library is hosted on an private GIT repo while he works on the basic code but in the future it would be installed using the following.

`npm install @adamwebster/fused-components`

# Importing components

To import components you want into your UI using the following:

`import { Button, Toggle } from @adamwebster/fused-components`

Which you can use in the following way
```
  const MyComponent = () => (
    <div>
      <Button>Adam's Button</Button>
      <Toggle />
    </div>
  )
```
